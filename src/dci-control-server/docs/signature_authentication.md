# Signature Authentication

Signature Authentication is the authentication mechanism used to authenticate API requests originating from a RemoteCI client.

A RemoteCI client allow to have credentials dedicated to a RemoteCI shared with the members of a team (contrary to user credentials which should be kept personal).

A signed API requests allows to:

 * Authenticate a request with:
     * a RemoteCI ID,
     * an API secret.
 * Secured against modification during transit as all its content is signed.
 * Secured aginst replay by carrying a timestamp (which is also part of the signed content) which must fit in Â± 5 minutes around the reception of the request on the server.

## Implementation

Along each request, the client must add the two following HTTP headers:

 * `DCI-Client-Info`
 * `DCI-Auth-Signature`

They are build as following

### DCI-Client-Info

It should look like: `DCI-Client-Info: <timestamp>/remoteci/<remoteci_id>` with:

 * `<timestamp>`: the current client timestamp in UTC timezone with the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSZ` (e.g.: `2017-06-12 14:29:17Z`)
 * `<remoteci_id>`: the RemoteCI ID found in the RemoteCI description

### DCI-Auth-Signature

The signature header `DCI-Auth-Signature: <signature>` is obtained with:

 * `<signature>`: `hexdigest( HMAC-SHA256( <api secret>, <string_to_sign>.encode('utf-8') ) )`
 * `<api secret>`: the API Secret found in the RemoteCI description
 * `<string_to_sign>`:

        <HTTP Verb> + "\n"
        <Content-Type> + "\n"
        <timestamp> + "\n"
        <url> + "\n"
        <query_string> + "\n"
        <payload hash>

     * `<HTTP Verb>`: the HTTP method used in uppercase
     * `<Content-Type>`: Usually `application/json` for API calls
     * `<timestamp>`: as previously, the client timestamp in UTC timezone with the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SSZ`
     * `<url>`: the resource path, without query string
     * `<query_string>`: the parameter passed when querying (the part after the `?` in the full URL)
     * `<payload hash>`: `hexdigest( SHA256( payload ) )`

As an example, the following request:

    PUT https://api.distributed-ci.io/api/v1/resource?param1=lala&param2=trololo

With the following JSON payload:

    { 'item': 'value', 'something': 'else', 'number': 51 }

Would have the following `string_to_sign`:

    PUT
    application/json
    2042-07-19 13:37:51Z
    /api/v1/resource
    param1=lala&param2=trololo
