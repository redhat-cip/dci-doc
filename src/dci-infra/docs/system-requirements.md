# System Requirements

## Storage

The DCI Control-Server (aka the API server) application aims to store the logs of various agents running a given job. The computational part does not happen in the Control-Server itself but rather on those agents running somewhere else.

When planning to deploy a DCI Control-Server, you need to plan storage capabilities carefully, as the stored data will continually grow. In large installations this data my grow quite quickly.

## Supported Platforms

 * Server: CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora 23
 * Client: CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora 23
 * Web browser: Chrome, Firefox

**For RHEL7 the following channels need to be enabled:**

 * rhel-7-server-extras-htb-rpms (python-werkzeug)
 * rhel-7-server-openstack-5.0-rpms (python-flask, python-passlib)
 * rhel-7-server-openstack-7.0-rpms (python-elasticsearch)
 * rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms (Ansible, Elasticsearch)
 * rhel-7-server-optional-rpms (epel dependendcies)
 * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms (epel dependencies)

If you are running Ansible &lt; 2.0, you need to apply a specific

> patch so that one can provision RHEL 7 servers.
>
> In 1.9.4 subscribing to Red Hat entitlement doesn't work.
>
> Please run the following commands to fix that behavior
>
>     # curl -o /tmp/ansible_fix_poolid_capitalization.patch http://dci.enovance.com/patches/ansible_fix_poolid_capitalization.patch
>
>     # patch /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/core/packaging/os/redhat_subscription.py -i ~/fix_poolid_capitalization.patch

If you are running Ansible &lt; 2.0, you need to install gnupg on

> Fedora 23 (gnupg2 is installed by default) as Ansible only looks for the gpg binary to do rpm\_key
