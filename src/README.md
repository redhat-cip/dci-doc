# DCI

## Objective

The goal of Distributed CI (DCI) is to reduce the delay between a new Red Hat OSP release, the first certification of the partner products, and ability to test versions of pre-GA on multiple hardware deployments faster. DCI will use this platform to deploy and test the current development versions directly from Red Hat with partnerâ€™s configurations, within their environments.

Through the use of DCI, information can be gleaned across a swath of different environments prior to a full release. With this method, issues can be identified more quickly, and a higher degree of confidence can be established that an upgrade will be successful.
