# Welcome on the Distributed CI (DCI) documentation

DCI is a powerful continuous integration (CI) toolkit developed by Red Hat. These tools are intended for Red Hat engineers and its technical partners. With DCI, you can accelerate the implementation of continuous integration on your servers to test your products on top of Red Hat products.

If you would like to have access to development versions of products like RHEL or OpenShift. If you want to go faster in creating continuous integration on your servers. If you want to facilitate communication with Red Hat engineers. Then you are in the right place.

DCI is a set of RPMs and ansible roles. You can use them to install and test Red Hat products. You can extend its functionality to add your products on top of Red Hat products.

# Is DCI right for me?

If you build drivers for the RHEL kernel, if you build operators for OpenShift or if you are an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) and you develop software on top of RHEL or OpenShift then yes you are in the right place.

Even if you already have CI tools like Jenkins you can use DCI. DCI fits seamlessly into your workflow.

You are also in the right place if you are a hardware vendor and you want to test the installation and certification of your equipment in advance.

# Ok Iâ€™m in, how can I continue ?

If you are not familiar with DCI you can visit the [general concepts](general_concepts) page to understand how it works.

If you want to access the user interface and start using our tools, you can visit the [Get Started page](get_started).

If you want to go into more detail to create your CI for RHEL or for OpenShift, you can visit the corresponding sections:
