Objective
=========

The goal of Distributed CI is to reduce the delay between a new Red Hat OSP
release, the first certification of the partner products and ability to test on
versions pre-GA faster. To take full advantage of DCI, the different partners
will need to this. DCI will use this platform to deploy and test the current
development versions directly from Red Hat with partnerâ€™s configurations, on
their environments.
